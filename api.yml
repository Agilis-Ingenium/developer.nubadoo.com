  description: |
    Welcome to the Nubadoo Health Tracker API! Developers can seamlessly harness the extensive capabilities of our platform and effortlessly integrate our services into their applications.
    
    Our API operates as a robust HTTP-based system, embracing the principles of REST architecture. With clearly defined resource URLs, it offers predictable endpoints for streamlined navigation. Error responses are communicated using standard HTTP status codes. Request payloads are accepted and responses are delivered in JSON format.
    
    You can effortlessly interact with our API using your preferred HTTP/REST library in your programming language of choice. Additionally, tools like Postman or CURL can facilitate easy access and testing of Nubadoo's API.
    
    Enjoy coding and exploring our API! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€

    # HTTP Response Status Codes
    HTTP response status codes show whether or not a particular HTTP request was completed successfully. Section 10 of [RFC 2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616) defines the status codes listed below. [RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231) contains an updated specification.
    
    The Nubadoo Health Tracker API makes use of the following HTTP status codes, grouped into three classes:
    
    ## Successful Responses - 2XX
    
    ### 200 - OK
    
    The request has succeeded.
    
    ### 201 - Created
    
    As a result of the request's success, a new resource has been generated. This is the response that is normally sent in response to POST or some PUT queries.
    
    ## Client Error - 4XX
    
    ### 400 - Bad Request
    Due to incorrect syntax, the server was unable to understand the request.
    
    ### 401 - Unauthorized
    Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
    
    ### 403 - Forbidden
    The server refuses to provide the requested resource because the client does not have access permissions to the resource; that is, it is unauthorized. Unlike 401, the server is aware of the client's identity.
    
    ### 404 - Not Found
    The requested resource was not found. The client is free to make additional requests.
    
    ### 405 - Method Not Allowed
    A GET request on a form that needs data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource, for example, is not supported for the requested resource.
    
    ## Server Error - 5XX
    
    ### 500 - Internal Server Error
    The server has come upon a circumstance that it is unsure how to handle.  Our team will be reviewing the root cause of issues and resolving the problems as soon as possible.
